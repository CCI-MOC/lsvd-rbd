\section{Introduction}

- Distributed networked storage has high demands on bandwidth and on the storage medium

- Traditionally solved with a write-back cache, but that makes state management hard

- Small writes are incredibly costly, you need consistency/replication semantics on every request

- We propose a log-structured virtual disk on a central storage gateway, on top
  of immutable objects

Benefits:

- We get statistical multiplexing between different clients

- Built on top of immutable objects = trivial caching

- Batched writes for good write performance

- Snapshots and clones are trivial

- Elastic backend to prevent low-space GC thrashing
