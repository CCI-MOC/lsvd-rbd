\section{Results}

- microbenchmarks: fio randread/write, vary bs, qd, 
- filebench

- compare lsvd/rbd
- theoretical upper limit with local nvme

- latency histograms? bimodal of hit/miss should show up somewhere
- vm boot results
- image optimization

Notes on figures themselves:

- Separate by workload instead of config 
  -- ex one fileserver graph with all the configs instead of multiple with fileserver

Fig1. File benchmark result with 20GB Cache and 80GB Volume. 

- The hdd with lsvd is comparable to rbd and lsvd with ssd

Fig2. File benchmark result with 240GB Cache and 80GB Volume.

- The result is similar to small cache (should we keep both?)
