/**
 * Core LSVD image class. An LSVD image supports 4 operations: read, write,
 * trim, and flush. All are async to prevent function colour issues.
 *
 * Currently, a lot of core image functionality is in the `translate` class.
 * The separation between what is here and what is there is not clear, and the
 * two classes really should be consolidated, and the GC function splitted out
 * into its own class.
 *
 * For now, all the core information about the image is owned by this class,
 * and `translate` only takes references to it. Most of the translate code was
 * from long ago, written by people who are no longer around. It's written like
 * a C program, and the ownership structure of most resources is unclear, with
 * sketchy concurrency control and C++ style.
 *
 * Eventually we'll have to rewrite the core translation class to clarify
 * resource ownership and to overhaul the disastrous locking situation, but
 * that's only a dream for now
