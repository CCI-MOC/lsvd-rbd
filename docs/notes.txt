possible config file options:

https://github.com/CJLove/config-cpp - modeled on Viper, but doesn't
handle environment variables

https://github.com/marzer/tomlplusplus - TOML only
but looking through the tests it seems like you can stuff a string
into std::stringstream and feed it to the parser.

hmm, maybe https://github.com/WizardCarter/simple-config-library
might give better parsing errors?

list of changes I want to make.

translation layer complexity:
- better way to handle batches
- move sequence number into instance
- simplify backend interface, use object_name(seq)
- get rid of in-memory stuff, update map on batch write

how the hell do we handle clones? The problem is that currently the
backend is the steward of the prefix, but we want it in the
translation layer to handle clones.

management functions:
-  rbd_create/rbd_remove,
-  rbd_clone
-  rbd_snap_create/rbd_snap_remove

general implementation stuff:
- configuration file

measure throughput of writing 8MB objects with N threads

Do something better than those thread pools? no, probably wait until I
talk to Red Hat about them.

misc stuff:
- maybe merge aio_read_req and aio_write_req structures?
- add backend pacing, maybe have aio_write_req directly submit to
  translation layer
- run perf
- merge nvme, nvme_request
- add wait() to requests, use nvme for all SSD I/O
